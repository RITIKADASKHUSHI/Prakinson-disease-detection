# Prakinson-disease-detection
Detection of Parkinson disease using speech data .We collected speech data from 107 people and then for its prediction we used some ML algorithms 
like KNN, Decision Tree and Random Forest.
To find out which algorithm will be best for this purpose we did a comparative analysis between them and also found out their respective accuracies.
